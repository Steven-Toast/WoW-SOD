I modified an existing exorcism weakaura that I found, with a sound byte saying "The power of christ compels you!"  When exorcism is ready, a graphic pops up and the sound will play.

Save the sound file into a new folder named CustomSounds that you need to create in your Addons folder.  Should look something like this:
C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns\CustomSounds
